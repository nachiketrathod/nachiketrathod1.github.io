     <strong>GT;DR: </strong>
</h3>

In a recent assessment of a web application's security, a **`robust login`** **rate-limiting** mechanism was encountered. After several unsuccessful login attempts, the application blocked further access and displayed an error message. Despite this challenge, we explored various methods to bypass the mechanism. Initially, `standard techniques` didn't work, but with determination and **`creative problem-solving`**, we successfully bypassed the rate-limiting mechanism. This experience emphasized the importance of perseverance and innovative thinking in overcoming complex security challenges.

# Investigating Rate Limiting Mechanism: üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After trying **known methods**, we attempted to understand how the rate limiting was implemented. We intercepted the requests and tried to brute force using an intruder. We tested **`180 different password combinations`**. After completing the attack, we observed that the application implemented rate limiting after **`23 unsuccessful attempts`**, throwing the **error message:** <mark>'Too many incorrect attempts. Please try again later.'</mark> This occurred even when entering a valid username.

# Demonstrating the Attack: ü™ì


**`Step-1:`**
 * Intercept the application's `login` request and redirect it to the intruder. 
 * Next, select the password position and choose the **`sniper-attack`** option. 
 * Enter the **`password combinations`** and initiate the attack.
 *  Upon completion of the attack, observe that the application threw an `error message` after multiple incorrect attempts, indicating the **presence of proper rate limiting**<br>

<figcaption>Fig 1. The application has implemented a request rate limit.</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-2:`**
* After completing the attack, attempt to enter the `valid password` in the **repeat request**, resulting in an error.
* Despite entering the **`correct password`**, the error still persists.

<img src="/assets/blogs/RateLimit/2.png" alt="F2" style="border:2px solid purple">
<figcaption>Fig 2. Observe the response with valid passowrd</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-3:`**
* Now, append the common character **`'%20'`** to the username parameter.
* Surprisingly, this **bypassed the rate-limiting** and allowed logging into the application using the valid password even after `numerous incorrect password` attempts.

<figcaption>Fig 3. observe the success response(Redirection).</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-4:`**
* Permform the brute-force attack to find the valid password **after adding `'%20'` to the username** parameter.
* Even after completing the brute force attack, the `error message` remained the same: <mark>'Too many incorrect attempts. Please try again later.'</mark>
* Unfortunately, `adding` the command character **`'%20' didn't work during the brute-force`** attack.

<img src="/assets/blogs/RateLimit/4.png" alt="F4" style="border:2px solid purple">
<figcaption>Fig 4. Observe the error message again.</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-5:`**
* Upon attempting a brute force attack, repeat **`Step-2`** and observe the same error message.

<img src="/assets/blogs/RateLimit/5.png" alt="F5" style="border:2px solid purple">
<figcaption>Fig 5. Observe the same error message.</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-6:`**
* After a comprehensive analysis, a **`new method`** was attempted: **`incrementally adding '%20'`** in each request, which resulted in `bypassing the rate-limiting` of password attempts.
* For **`example`**, in the first request, **Add** the **`'%20' once`**, and in the **`second request, add it twice`**. Repeat this process till 180 requests, adding 180 '%20' characters.
* Choose the Attack-type: **`Pitchfork`**.

<figcaption>Fig 6. Choose the attack type and payload positions.</figcaption>
</figure>

**`Step-7:`**
* Utilize below `Python code` to generate incremental '%20' characters.

```bash
# Initialize the initial string
pattern = "%20"
 
# Loop 180 times to print the pattern
for i in range(1, 181):
    # Print the pattern for the current iteration
    print(f"Time {i}: {pattern}")
    # Add another "%20" to the pattern for the next iteration
    pattern += "%20"
```
<br>
* Utilize the generated payloads at **`position one`**, which corresponds to the `username parameter`.

</figure>

**`Step-8:`**
* Observe the `last request` after completing the attack, where **`'%20' was appended`** 180 times to the username parameter.

</figure>

**`Step-9:`**
* Observe that the login **`rate-limit`** was **`bypassed`**.

* Allowing the application to find a **`valid credentials`** after numerous unsuccessful password attempts.

# Conclusion:

It's crucial **`not to give up`** when faced with login rate limiting on applications. If default methods prove ineffective, there are **`numerous alternative ways`** to bypass these limitations. By thinking `outside the box` and creating new methods, it's possible to overcome even the most robust security measures. This adaptability underscores the importance of continuous **`vigilance and innovation`** in the field of security.
